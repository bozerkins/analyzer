# Pure glass analytics

## Description

The framework provides functionality on stable data receiving and aggregation for further analysis.

A program built with PHP / MySQL technology stack, is easy to download and install on your webserver. Provided functionality contains easy to maintain PHP aggregator modules, that can be customized and adapted to your digitalized data sources. Reporting system implements basic data representation principles, which are highly extendable, including in-depth data overview and detailed views.

Based on aquired information data structure implies both relational representation and summary tables representation, which makes data aquiring mechanism more efficient, provides more control over what happens with data behind the scene.

Aimed at realtime processing, Pure glass analytics provides a strong basis for minor BIs data analysis.

## Requirements

  * PHP 5.3.3 or greater
  * PDO library must be enabled
  * MySQL 4.1 or greater
  * Compatible with Linux servers

## Functionality information

What makes Pure glass analytics different from other BI tools

 * It is not a ready software soltion, but a framework for BI, thus is extendable and adaptable within given environment.
 * Provides real time data analysis tools, which can be used for any data aggregation and storage.
 * Implements mapping and aggregator modules, extendable to custom data processing
 * Implements on-demand data summarization, by storing relational data aggregated into dimensions
 * Implements dimensional service, which provides full control over data dimensions (data attributes to group by)
 * Implements relational data storage, which is aggregated into dimensions, thus storing RAW data is fully optional
 * Provides data processing monitoring interface and tools, which makes it easier to manage the whole system

Aiming at easy to use data processing is a key factor in Pure glass analytics development.
